  <p>Coding refers to the process of creating instructions that a computer or other electronic device can understand and execute. It involves using programming languages such as Python, Java, or C++ to write logic and commands that tell the computer what to do. Coding is essential to the development of software, websites, and applications, and is increasingly important in many other fields as well. As technology continues to advance, coding skills are becoming increasingly valuable and in-demand.</p>
